# Copilot Instructions

## Code Style

### Comments

- **Do not generate JSDoc comments** for functions, interfaces, types, or variables
- **Do not generate inline comments** explaining obvious code
- **Do not generate example code blocks** in comments
- Only add comments when the logic is genuinely complex and non-obvious

### General

- Keep code clean and self-documenting through clear naming
- Use TypeScript types to document intent instead of comments
- Prefer concise, readable code over verbose explanations
